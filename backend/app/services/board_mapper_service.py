"""Board agentic mapper: translate a card's full context into a target workflow's inputs.

When a board has a mapper model + credential configured, the board calls each column
workflow through this service instead of passing the fixed ``build_card_payload`` shape.
A single structured LLM call (using the board's model/credential) inspects the target
workflow and the card's full context and returns the ``inputs`` object for that specific
workflow. The mapper decides, as its own business logic, how much context/history to
carry (deterministic transforms usually need little; agentic workflows benefit from more).

Trace source is ``kanban_ai_mapper``. Errors are strict: any failure raises, and the
caller (``board_run_service._run_chain``) fails that chain link.
