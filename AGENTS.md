You are an expert full-stack AI/ML engineer building Heym, an n8n-like AI workflow automation platform with visual editor.

## AI Coding Agents (Required)
Read and follow this `AGENTS.md` at the start of every session. Repository conventions and policies override default agent behavior.

## Essential Commands

### Quick Start
```bash
./run.sh                    # Start all services (postgres, backend, frontend)
./run.sh --no-debug         # Start with INFO logging instead of DEBUG
./check.sh                  # Run frontend lint/typecheck, backend Ruff checks, and backend tests
./run_e2e.sh                # Run frontend Playwright E2E tests separately
SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key-for-tests-only-32-bytes ./check.sh  # Use when no SECRET_KEY is exported locally
```

### Frontend (Vue.js + Bun)
```bash
cd frontend && bun install && bun run dev    # Setup && start dev server (port 4017)
bun run lint                  # ESLint - must pass before commits
bun run typecheck             # TypeScript strict checks - must pass before commits
bun run test                  # Vitest unit tests (enforced in CI, not part of ./check.sh)
bun run build && bun run preview  # Build && test production build
```

### Backend (Python 3.11+ + FastAPI + UV)
```bash
cd backend && uv sync && uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 10105
./run_tests.sh               # Run all backend unit tests in parallel (required before git push)
SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key-for-tests-only-32-bytes ./run_tests.sh  # Full backend tests when no SECRET_KEY is exported
uv run pytest tests/test_file.py::ClassName::test_method  # Run specific test
uv run ruff check .           # Linting (fix with --fix) - must pass before commits
uv run ruff format .          # Auto-format code
uv run ruff format --check .  # Verify formatting without changing files
```

### Database & Docker
```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres  # Start PostgreSQL only (port 6543)
cd backend && uv run alembic upgrade head  # Run database migrations (required after schema changes)
docker-compose up -d          # Start all services (pg:6543, backend:10105, frontend:4017)
```

## Code Style Rules

### Import Order (CRITICAL)
**TypeScript:** Vue imports → External libs → Internal types → Internal code
**Python:** Standard library → Third-party → Internal

### TypeScript Requirements
- strict mode ONLY (noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters enabled)
- Explicit return types (`function getName(): string`)
- `interface` > `type` for objects
- `const` > `let`
- Unused params must be prefixed with `_`
- Async/await not Promise chains
- Vue: Composition API with `<script setup>`, file names: PascalCase, max 300 lines

### Python Requirements
- Type hints everywhere (returns included)
- Pydantic models for APIs, dataclasses for data (not dicts)
- Docstrings on public functions
- Ruff formatter only (line length: 100, double quotes, space indent)

### Error Handling
**Frontend:** Typed catches with axios error handling
**Backend:** FastAPI HTTPException only, never generic exceptions

### API Design
RESTful endpoints, Pydantic models for all requests/responses, paginated (limit/offset), OpenAPI docs at `/docs`

### Database
SQLAlchemy 2.0 async, UUID primary keys only, Alembic for migrations, index frequently queried columns

### Testing
Backend: pytest with unittest.TestCase/IsolatedAsyncioTestCase, AsyncMock for DB mocking
Frontend unit tests: Vitest specs live at `frontend/src/**/*.test.ts`; run with `bun run test`. Enforced in the CI `check` job, not in `./check.sh`.
Frontend E2E: Playwright specs live in `frontend/e2e/`; run them with `./run_e2e.sh` from the repository root
**New features must include backend tests** - run `./check.sh` before git push (includes backend tests via `./run_tests.sh`)
**New UI behavior should include Playwright E2E coverage when practical.** E2E tests run as a separate required job in PR checks and are intentionally excluded from `./check.sh` to keep the default local check path fast.
If the local environment does not export `SECRET_KEY`, prefix full-suite commands with `SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key-for-tests-only-32-bytes` (test-only value; never use it for runtime/prod).

### Secret handling (capability secrets)
A capability secret is any value that grants access on its own: API keys, session tokens, share links, webhook auth headers. `backend/app/services/secret_tokens.py` holds the one hashing helper; do not add a second.

- **Hash at rest, and never accept the stored form as a credential.** Persist `hash_secret(value)` and look rows up with a plain equality on the digest. A lookup that also tries the presented value verbatim will match a stored digest, which hands anyone who can read the database a working credential and defeats the point of hashing. Every such column gets a backfilling migration instead of a runtime fallback.
- **A migration that backfills digests can only be guarded when the plaintext is shape-distinguishable from a digest.** `secrets.token_hex(32)` is 64 lowercase hex characters, identical in shape to SHA-256, so a "skip if it looks hashed" guard would skip every real key. `secrets.token_urlsafe(n)` is distinguishable and can be guarded. Document which case applies, and that downgrade cannot restore plaintext.
- **Return once, at creation.** The endpoint that mints a secret returns it; nothing returns it again. List and config endpoints expose a `*_set: bool` flag so the UI can say "configured" without reading it, and the frontend holds the freshly minted value in a session-scoped ref for copy actions.
- **Keep credentials out of URLs.** Accept them from headers only. Query strings reach access logs, proxy logs, browser history and Referer headers. Short-lived in-memory handshake parameters such as the MCP `?session=` token are the exception.
- **Owner-only secrets stay owner-only for reads and writes.** Mask them for collaborators in the response schema and reject collaborator writes. Masking the read without guarding the write lets a masked, empty editor field autosave over the owner's value.
- **Redact at every persistence boundary, not just the obvious one.** A request-derived secret usually reaches more than one structure: run inputs, node outputs, `node_results`, and sub-workflow history are separate columns. Redacting one moves the secret rather than removing it. Use one recursive redactor per run and apply it at each write.
- **When touching any of the above:** add focused tests under `backend/tests/test_advisory_*.py`, including the negative case that the stored representation does not authenticate.

### OpenCode session headers (required for future LLM integrations)
Every model request to OpenCode must include a nonempty `x-opencode-session` header for prompt caching.

- Use the shared client factories in `backend/app/services/openai_client.py`. Detect OpenCode from the credential's explicit `base_url` hostname (`opencode.ai`); do not rely on an `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable.
- Pass the conversation ID as `session_id`, including through `LLMTraceContext.session_id` and `WorkflowExecutor.llm_session_id` where applicable. Keep it stable across follow-ups, retries, tool calls, sub-workflows, and pause/resume. Start a new ID for each new conversation.
- Chat and assistant surfaces must preserve their conversation ID across requests. Kanban uses the card ID across reruns and column moves. Standalone workflow runs can use the execution ID. If no ID is available, generate a UUID and retain it for that conversation; never send an empty header.
- When adding a new LLM call path or changing a coding-agent SDK/CLI integration, verify that the outgoing OpenCode model requests carry this header with the correct session scope. Add regression coverage for stable follow-ups, distinct new conversations, and the nonempty fallback. Preserve the shared client's Heym User-Agent and SSRF protection.

### Node and operation integration
When adding a new node type, operation, or operation-specific field, keep the canvas affordances in sync with the schema:

- Update the node/operation DSL(workflow_dsl_prompt.py) and schema metadata as the source of truth for new fields, including labels, defaults, dynamic/expression eligibility, and AI autofill hints.
- Agent node tool fields must be available to AI autofill. If a field can be configured on a tool attached to an agent node, clicking the agent icon should be able to populate that field automatically.
- Dynamic/expression-capable fields must be exposed to the expression dialog metadata. When a node is double-clicked, the expression dialog should be able to show `1/n` navigation and dynamically fill every eligible field for that node/operation.
- When adding a **new node type**, update the docs that enumerate nodes: add the node page under `frontend/src/docs/content/nodes/`, register it in `frontend/src/docs/manifest.ts`, and add the node to the reference docs — including `frontend/src/docs/content/reference/features.md` (both the per-node section and the node-types summary list), plus `node-types.md` and, for credential-backed nodes, `integrations.md` / `credentials.md` / `credentials-sharing.md`. 
- Add or extend frontend tests for meaningful UI behavior changes when practical, especially for autofill eligibility and expression dialog field discovery.

### Node placement in a multi-instance cluster
Every node type must declare where it may run.
`backend/app/services/cluster/node_placement.py` holds one entry per node type;
`backend/tests/test_cluster_node_placement.py` fails the build when a node
registered in `node_execution/registry.py` has no entry. There is no default —
a missing entry is a build failure, not a silent fallback to the main instance.

Declare `MAIN_ONLY` when the node:
- reads or writes `FILE_STORAGE_DIR` (Heym Drive, attachments, generated files),
- leaves state on local disk that a later run reads back (coding-agent
  workspaces resumed through `workspace_path`),
- depends on something installed per instance rather than baked into the image
  (plugins),
- must keep one fixed outbound IP (`sendEmail`: corporate SMTP relays commonly
  allowlist the source address).

Declare `ANYWHERE` otherwise — including nodes that open a Docker sandbox. Every
instance in a cluster runs the same image with its own Docker socket, so a
sandbox is not a reason to pin a run to the main instance, and `code` and
`playwright` are exactly the CPU-heavy work worth moving off it.

When placement depends on configuration rather than node type — `agent` with a
skill tool attached — express it as a predicate over the node's own data in the
same module. Never branch on node type in the scheduler.

### Audit logging stays on the main instance
`audit()` writes a line to stdout and nothing to the database — see
`backend/app/services/audit_log.py`. In a cluster that line lands on the stdout
of whichever instance ran the code, so where it is called from decides whether
the audit trail stays in one place.

Call `audit()` from `backend/app/api/` routers only. Ingress points at the main
instance, so a router call keeps the whole trail on one machine, where a log
shipper can collect it. All 128 call sites are routers today; keep it that way.

Never call `audit()` from `workflow_executor.py`, a node handler, or anything
else reachable from the run queue. Those run on whichever instance claimed the
run, and the trail would split across machines without any error to notice.

When an audited action genuinely originates during execution, record it in the
run's own history instead. `execution_history` already carries
`executed_by_instance_id` and `executed_by_instance_name`, so it answers "who
did what, where" from one query. `file_intake_service.write_audit` is the
pattern: a helper that writes to a table, called from a router.

### PropertiesPanel modularity
`frontend/src/components/Panels/PropertiesPanel.vue` must stay a thin shell, not a node-specific implementation file. Node configuration UI belongs under `frontend/src/components/Panels/propertiesPanel/nodes/`, with one component per node type or shared paired node form (for example, `SetJsonOutputMapperNodeProperties.vue`). Node-specific helper state, computed values, API loading, and handlers should live with that node component or a sibling composable in the same `propertiesPanel/` module. Keep only cross-node panel orchestration, shared output/run handling, and context wiring in shared properties panel composables. When adding or changing a node property field, update the node-specific component instead of adding `selectedNode.type` branches to `PropertiesPanel.vue`.

### Expression evaluation (avoid executor vs dialog drift)
The canvas **expression evaluate** dialog (`/expressions/evaluate`, `ExpressionEvaluatorService`) and **workflow execution** (`WorkflowExecutor`) must agree on the same semantics for `$…` templates.

- **Core entry points** (touch these with extra care; keep behavior aligned):
  - `WorkflowExecutor.resolve_expression` — single full `$expr` and nested `$` inside the body after the leading `$` (`_substitute_nested_dollar_refs_for_eval`).
  - `WorkflowExecutor.resolve_arithmetic_expression` — used when `_has_arithmetic` is true (e.g. set/output schema/variable value fields); nested `$` inside one span is expanded in `replace_dollar_ref` before eval.
  - `WorkflowExecutor.evaluate_message_template` — per-span `resolve_expression` for each top-level `$…` match.
  - `ExpressionEvaluatorService` (`backend/app/services/expression_evaluator.py`) — mirrors executor rules for the API; changes should stay consistent with `workflow_executor.py`.
- **When changing any of the above:** extend or add cases in `backend/tests/test_expression_evaluator_service.py` (and related executor tests if behavior crosses modules). Prefer one shared helper over node-specific string eval.
- **Anti-pattern:** Resolving user expressions with ad-hoc `eval` / string concat outside these paths — causes preview vs run mismatches.

### Adding a new expression (operator, method, or function)
An expression is only shipped when every one of these is done in the same change:

1. **Implement it on the Dot wrapper or in the function registry** in `backend/app/services/workflow_executor.py`. Add both the camelCase name and the `snake_case` alias, matching the neighbours.
2. **Add a row to `OPERATOR_CASES`** in `backend/tests/test_expression_operator_smoke.py`. `TestExpressionOperatorCoverage` fails the build when a wrapper method or a registered function has no case, so this is not optional. The matrix asserts the value three ways: through a real `set` node run, through `ExpressionEvaluatorService` (the dialog), and through `$sample` / `$vars` / `$global` so no context root can lose an operator.
3. **Add a row to `OPERATOR_CASES`** in `frontend/e2e/expression-operators.spec.ts` when the expression belongs to a new family or is likely to behave differently on the canvas. That spec runs one `set` node from the editor and replays every expression through `/api/expressions/evaluate`.
4. **Update the DSL prompt and the expression metadata** (`workflow_dsl_prompt.py`, the expression dialog's method list and autocomplete previews) so the AI assistant and the dialog can offer it.
5. **Update the docs** — the expression reference under `frontend/src/docs/content/` — plus a release tour entry if the expression is user-visible.

**Names Python reserves are a trap.** `$global` was silently broken for months because `global.x` cannot be parsed by `ast.parse`: every `$global…` expression fell through to the fallback resolver, which only knows a handful of no-argument string helpers, and returned `null` for everything else. `alias_reserved_context_names()` in `expression_syntax.py` rewrites such names before parsing, and every parse must go through `_parse_expression_tree` / `HeymExpressionEval.eval` so the rewrite is applied. If you add a context root, check it is not a Python keyword.

### OpenTelemetry tracing (keep span seams aligned)
OTel tracing is env-gated (`HEYM_OTEL_ENABLED`, disabled by default) and bootstrapped in `backend/app/observability/tracing.py` from `app/main.py`'s `setup_tracing(app)`. Spans are added at three seams only:
- `WorkflowExecutor.execute` wraps a `heym.workflow.execute` root span and stores the active OTel context in `self._otel_root_context`.
- `WorkflowExecutor.execute_node` wraps a `heym.node.execute` child span and re-attaches `self._otel_root_context` so node spans nest under the workflow span across `ThreadPoolExecutor` workers (see `tracing.run_with_context`).
- `LLMService.execute_with_tools` wraps each Agent tool invocation in a `heym.agent.tool.execute` child span while the Agent node span is active. Tool spans contain bounded identity, status, timing, and size metadata only; raw arguments and results are not span attributes.
- **When changing the executor's parallel/thread submit logic or any of these three seams:** preserve the context capture/re-attach and Agent node → tool parentage, and extend `backend/tests/test_observability_tracing.py`. Custom attributes use the `heym.*` prefix. Tracing must never break execution (failures are swallowed); the read-only status lives at `GET /api/config/observability`.

### WorkflowExecutor modularity
`backend/app/services/workflow_executor.py` must stay responsible for workflow orchestration, retries, tracing, cancellation, expression helpers, and shared result packaging. Node-specific execution logic belongs under `backend/app/services/node_execution/nodes/`, with one handler module per node type and registration in `backend/app/services/node_execution/registry.py`.

- Do not add new `node_type` branches or node-specific business logic to `WorkflowExecutor._execute_node_logic`; route new or changed node behavior through a modular node handler.
- Keep handler changes behavior-preserving unless the task explicitly asks for product behavior changes. Handlers may use `NodeExecutionContext.executor` for shared executor services, but should not duplicate retry, tracing, cancellation, or final `NodeResult` packaging.
- When adding a new node type, add its handler, register it in the node execution registry, update the node DSL/schema/docs required by the node integration policy, and add focused backend tests for the handler behavior.

### Alert type modularity
`backend/app/services/alerts/evaluator.py` owns claiming, the fire/recover state machine, event packaging, notify dispatch, and error containment. Metric computation for each alert type belongs under `backend/app/services/alerts/types/`, one module per alert type, registered in `backend/app/services/alerts/registry.py`.

- Do not add `alert_type` branches to the evaluator. A new alert type is one handler module, one registry entry, one config model in `backend/app/models/alert_schemas.py`, and focused tests.
- Handlers compute a metric over a window and return an `AlertObservation`. They must not write events, dispatch notifications, mutate alert state, or re-derive scope — `workflow_ids` arrives already resolved on the `AlertEvaluationContext`.
- Cost metrics must resolve USD through `app/services/llm_pricing.py`, and duration percentiles through `app/api/analytics.py::calculate_percentile`. An alert that disagrees with the Traces or Analytics tab about the same window is worse than no alert.
- Evaluation runs inside the leader-gated `CronScheduler` loop and claims rows with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` while advancing `next_check_at` in the same statement. Preserve that claim when touching the loop; without it a leader handoff mid-pass double-fires.
- The frontend mirrors this: `StepCondition.vue` selects per-type field components from a lookup map, not a `v-if` chain, and node-type-style branching does not belong in `AlertsTab.vue`.
- When adding a new alert type, also update `frontend/src/docs/content/tabs/alerts-tab.md`, `reference/features.md`, and the alert tool descriptions in `backend/app/api/ai_assistant.py`.

### Release tour (announce user-visible work)
**Any change a user can see must ship with its release tour entry in the same change.** A feature nobody discovers was not delivered. This covers new UI, new node types, new tabs or panels, and reworked UX flows. Pure refactors, backend-only changes, and bug fixes with no visible surface are exempt.

The system lives in `frontend/src/features/release-tour/`, mounted through `ReleaseTourHost.vue`. It is **desktop only** (above the 768px breakpoint) and is mounted on three screens: the dashboard (every tab), Chat, and Docs. The launcher button teleports into `#release-tour-launcher-slot`, which each of those views puts in `AppHeader`'s `before-docs` slot. The header button appears immediately; only the *automatic* popup waits for a screen's intro video to be dismissed. `releaseRegistry.ts` is the source of truth; `releaseTourMapper.ts` holds the pure logic and must stay side-effect free.

- Add a section to the **current unreleased** entry in `releaseRegistry.ts`: `id`, `title`, a `blocks` prose summary, and `tour` metadata (`description`, `useCases`, `tourVisual`).
- List the new section's `id` in that release's `sectionOrder`. A section missing from `sectionOrder` never reaches the tour.
- Build a matching animated mock under `components/visuals/` and register it in `tourVisuals.ts` under the same `tourVisual` key. An unregistered key silently falls back to the neutral visual, so the registry test in `releaseTourMapper.test.ts` guards this — keep it passing.
- Visuals are **mock UI, never live UI**: Tailwind semantic tokens, no production API calls, no host-page state. Animate with CSS transitions, Vue `<Transition>`, and `useCycleStep` for looping demo states; there is no motion library and adding one needs a separate decision.
- Keep `tourEnabled: false` on a release that is still in progress, then flip it to `true` in the release commit. The registry still renders release notes while the flag is off — it only gates the automatic popup.
- Start a new release entry (new `releaseId`, newer `publishedAt`) once the previous one has shipped. Only the newest enabled release is ever shown, so old unseen releases do not queue up behind it.
- Bump `TOUR_REVISION` only to deliberately re-show an already-announced release; it invalidates every user's stored "seen" state.
- E2E: `prepareAuthenticatedPage` marks the current tour seen (`heym-release-tour-seen`, same idea as `showcase_seen_*`) so the auto-open panel does not intercept clicks. Specs that cover the popup pass `{ allowReleaseTour: true }`. Keep the seeded versioned id in `frontend/e2e/support.ts` aligned with the newest enabled `releaseId` and `TOUR_REVISION`.

## Tech Guidelines
- **Vue Flow:** Use `@vue-flow/core`, custom nodes extend `BaseNode.vue`, store nodes/edges in Pinia
- **Pinia:** Stores in `frontend/src/stores/`, use composition API `defineStore`, export typed interfaces
- **FastAPI:** Use dependency injection via `app/api/deps.py`, sessions via `get_db()`, auth via `get_current_user()`
- **Testing:** Backend uses pytest (tests in `backend/tests/`, run with `uv run pytest tests/`). Frontend unit tests use Vitest (`frontend/src/**/*.test.ts`, `bun run test`, enforced in CI). Frontend E2E tests use Playwright (specs in `frontend/e2e/`, run with `./run_e2e.sh`). **New features and meaningful behavior changes must include or extend backend tests** covering the touched code paths; new UI behavior should include Playwright coverage when practical.
- **Tests use** unittest.TestCase and unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase with AsyncMock for database mocking

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vue.js 3 + TypeScript (strict) + Vite + Bun + Shadcn Vue + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python 3.11+ + FastAPI + UV + SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async) + Pydantic
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 + AsyncPG
- **Auth:** JWT (access + refresh) + bcrypt

## MCP Tools & Skills
Use `sequentialthinking` for complex planning, `shadcn` for UI components. Always query for skills before starting. Use `heym-documentation` skill when documentation changes are involved.

## Feature Documentation Policy
Medium/large features (new UI, node types, APIs, UX) must update docs via `heym-documentation` skill. Small bug fixes/refactors do not require doc updates. The same threshold triggers a release tour entry — see **Release tour (announce user-visible work)**.

## Licensing
MIT with Commons Clause condition - open for use, not for commercial resale. See LICENSE and COMMONS-CLAUSE.md.

## Critical Notes
- **Git workflow:** Work directly on `main` branch — no worktrees, no feature branches. Commit and push to main.
- **Before git push:** Run `./check.sh` from the repo root (applies `ruff format` on the backend, then lint and tests). Commit any formatting-only diffs with your changes.
- **Schema changes:** Always run `uv run alembic upgrade head` after migrations
- **Order matters:** PostgreSQL must be running before backend starts (run.sh handles this)
- **Never commit:** Secrets, env files, or Turkish text in code/comments
- **Cursor Cloud:** Start Docker daemon → postgres → migrations → backend (PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALL_AT_STARTUP=false) → frontend
